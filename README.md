# jobgrid

## ideas
  - import applications via csv
  - autogenerate sankey diagram to visualize applications
  - connect to email (optional) and parse email contents to auto update applications (i.e., find rejection email for company, update that application's status to rejected)
  - calendar integration for scheduled interviews, application dates, and recommended follow-ups
  - build an actually decent automatic AI resume tailor software per job description, based off a database of skills and projects you save to your profile
